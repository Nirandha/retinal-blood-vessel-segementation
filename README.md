# retinal-blood-vessel-segementation
Retinal vessel segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided diagnosis for eye diseases, as it 
allows for the precise delineation of blood vessels in retinal images. The process involves segmenting 
retinal vessels from the background, which is a complex task due to the varying vessel widths, curvatures, 
and the presence of noise in the images. Automated retinal vessel segmentation can assist healthcare 
professionals in diagnosing and monitoring eye conditions efficiently, potentially leading to earlier 
intervention and improved patient outcomes
